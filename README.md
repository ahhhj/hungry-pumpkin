This will give a security error when you download it and try to run it, and your antivirus might block it, automatically put it in a sandbox, or remove it from your computer. I know its not a virus, but if you are paricularly paranoid dont run it.
If you do run it, click control then play, or press ctrl+enter on your computer.
I dont own the original full game, and I know i dont know the whole story and background of the game, but please stick with me.

About a year ago when flash was still around, i searched around for a stand alone flash version of that hungry pumpkin game. My goal was to make it into a working exe file that i could send to my friends, because no one would be expecting a full working version of a game from a video they watched that was 10 years old. After a while of inspect element on many different websites, i found one where there was just a plain flash file. I put it through an online swf to exe generator and got it working.

I didnt compile it and dont know how the exe file works, but it does work.
I now decided to upload it here, as flash is no longer supported.
