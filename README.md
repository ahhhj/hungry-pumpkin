# hungry-pumpkin
Read the README

I dont own the original full game, and I know i dont know the whole story and background of the game, but please stick with me.

About a year ago when flash was still around, i searched around for a stand alone flash version of that hungry pumpkin game. My goal was to make it into a working exe file that i could send to my friends, because no one would be expecting a full working version of a game from a video they watched that was 10 years old. After a while of inspect element on many different websites, i found one where there was just a plain flash file. I put it through a swf to exe generator and got it working.

I now decided to upload it here, as flash is no longer supported.
